+Gobal average pooling
presented in "Network in Network". Less parameters. Using GlobalAveragePooling replace FC.
Also, another potential advantage is that FC will destory spatial information, may be not important for classification, but actually important for localization.(refer to "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization", CVPR2016, MIT)
